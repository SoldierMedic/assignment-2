# Traveling Salesperson Problem with Genetic Algorithm

This project solves the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm. The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest route that a salesperson can take to visit a given set of cities and return to the starting city.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Select python interpretor we used: `python 3.11`

3. Run the Flask web application by running the `sample-code.ipynb` file by using jupyter notebook:

4. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:5678`.

5. The homepage provides an overview of the Traveling Salesperson Algorithm, explaining how it works and its applications.

6. Click on the "See our Genetic Algorithm Results" button to view the results of the Genetic Algorithm applied to the TSP.

7. The Genetic Algorithm implementation utilizes the `genetic_algorithm.html` template file and generates a plot of the best route using matplotlib.
