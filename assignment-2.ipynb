    "## Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this application is to implement the Traveling Salesman Problem using genetic algorithms. The main program \"sample-code.ipynb\" is implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebook. Matplotlib is used to graph the results of the TSP, and the application is hosted on a localhost (http://127.0.0.1:5678) using Flask. Chat GPT was consulted for ideas and assistance during the design and implementation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application has a landing page that describes the TSP algorithm and its applications. There is a button on the landing page that leads to a page showing the result of the algorithm. Each time the page is requested, a new solution is generated.\n",
    "![](static/homepage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The group work was divided into the following roles:\n",
    "- The architect, Jeff, laid the foundation for the solution by planning the program design and determining the specifics of the genetic algorithm.\n",
    "- The developer, Marco, implemented the plan in the Jupyter notebook, created the Flask web app, and ensured its accessibility and accuracy.\n",
    "- The reporter, Alex, oversaw the documentation of the solution and wrote this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "1. How were the cities and distances represented (as a data structure)?\n",
    "   - The cities and distances were represented as a Python list data type called \"dataset,\" with each entry containing the coordinates of a city.\n",
    "   ![](static/dataset.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How did you encode the solution space?\n",
    "   - The solution space is represented by the population of routes. The genetic algorithm explores this space to find an optimized solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How did you handle the creation of the initial population?\n",
    "   - The initial population was created using the random.shuffle() method. The population size was set to 50, and a function named \"generate_population\" was implemented to generate the initial population.\n",
    "   ![](static/Generate_population.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How did you compute the fitness score?\n",
    "   ![](static/FitnessScore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The fitness score was calculated using the reciprocal of the total distance for each route in the population. The fitness values were stored in a list named \"fitness\" using the following line of code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   fitness = [1 / calculate_route_distance(route) for route in population]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    - This line of code calculates the fitness values for each route in the population by computing the reciprocal of their respective total distances. These fitness values will be used in the genetic algorithm for selection, where routes with shorter distances (higher fitness) have a higher chance of being selected for reproduction and passing their genetic material to the next generation.\n",
    "    For every iteration we store this is in total_fitness which is being used a summation variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which parent selection strategy did you use? Why?\n",
    "    -\tWe used the roulette-wheel selection in the following line of code. \n",
    "        - parents = random.choices(population, weights=fitness, k=population_size)\n",
    "        - The reason for choosing this strategy is due to its simplicity and effectiveness in promoting the selection of fitter individuals while still allowing diversity in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which crossover strategy(ies) did you try? Which one worked out best?\n",
    "    -\tThe crossover strategy that was used was a variation of the partially-mapped crossover (PMX), it creates new offspring from selected parent routes. The PMX crossover strategy helps exchange genetic material between the selected parent routes, combining their characteristics to potentially create offspring with improved solutions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ![](static/Crossover.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which mutation strategy(ies) did you try? Which one worked out best?\n",
    "    -\tFor this implementation we went with a simple swap mutation. It introduces small variations into the routes of the population to explore different parts of the solution space. The swap mutation randomly selects two positions in a route and swaps the cities at those positions. This helps introduce randomness and explore different combinations of cities within a route.\n",
    " \n",
    "8. Which strategy did you use for populating the next generation? Why?\n",
    "    -\tThe strategy used for populating the next generation is generational replacement strategy. The new generation, is represented by the “new_generation” list, completely replacing the previous generation. The generational replacement strategy ensures that the newly generated routes (offspring) completely replace the existing routes in the population, forming the next generation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ![](/static/pop-gen.png)  \n",
    "9. Which stopping condition did you use? Why?\n",
    "    -\tThe number of generations “num_generations” in the function “evolve”, this is so the evolution process is executed within the bounds of the predefined limit for this test simulation. \n",
    "10. What other parameters, design choices, initialization and configuration steps are relevant to your design and implementation?\n",
    "    -\tThe flow of this program was straightforward, with methods to handle the various tasks needed in the program, such as calculating distance between cities, or generating an initial population randomly for each instance. For the parameters of the Genetic algorithm, we selected the population size, mutation rate, and number of generations at the start, and this obviously has a major influence on the results in the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](/static/GA_Parameters.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Which (simple) experiments have you run to observe the impact of different design decisions and parameter values? Post their results and your comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -\tOne basic experiment that can be run is refreshing the program as the result changes every time the program is run. The parameters that are initially declared, such as population size and number of generations had been altered to see result changes. As expected, the larger the range the longer time it takes to run and smaller values are quicker in execution but not as accurate as a larger sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# (Various results from refresh)\n",
    "![Result 1](static/RUN1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Result 2](static/RUN2.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Result 5](static/RUN5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number of generations was set to 10,000, and the running time took longer than the original 1,000 generations. The population size was reduced to 20, resulting in more overlapping points on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments:\n",
    "- The experiments showed that changing the parameters such as the number of generations and population size can have a significant impact on the result of the genetic algorithm.\n",
    "- Increasing the number of generations allows the algorithm to explore the solution space more thoroughly, potentially leading to better solutions.\n",
    "- Increasing the population size can provide more diversity and increase the chances of finding an optimal solution.\n",
    "- However, these changes also come with increased computational time and resource requirements.\n",
